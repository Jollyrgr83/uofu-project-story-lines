## **Description**

A simpler approach to agile project management. Fully manage your projects using agile concepts including projects, stories, and tasks without any unnecessary frustrations.

## **Objective**

Project management applications, such as Jira Software by Atlassian, are supremely helpful for agile teams through each stage of their project development.

Having a way to assign individual tasks, projects, and stories to each team member makes task delegation, tracking, and reaching deadlines both simple and organized.

We were motivated to create an effective application that was similar to these popular platforms but improved to our creative specifications. By first identifying what aspects of the existing system we wanted to change or improve, we then delegated tasks strategically.

By utilizing the same mindset behind the need for an application like Jira, we were able to dynamically tackle each necessary task in a precise and organized manner.

## **User Story**

As a busy software developer, I have a need for an easy-to-use project, story, and task management application.

## **Usage**

* Our program allows for a user login & sign-up before the app can be accessed.
* The sign-up feature automatically sends a welcome email and text message provided by the user. This information is saved for future logins and usage.
* Once a user either logs-in or signs-up, they are taken to the main Dashboard page.
* From the Dashboard page, the user may navigate to a number of funcional pages, including a Project page, a Story page, and a Search page.
* The Dashboard page also provides the user with general information related to them, including active projects and active stories; each may be selected individually.
* Our app’s Navbar uses vector art as clickable buttons for page navigation.
* From the Navbar, the user can quickly Return Home, Add a Project, Search the App, as well as logout of their user account.
* Upon logging-out, the user will be redirected to the sign-up page.
* We color-coded the “days remaining” icons that rest beside each story on the Dashboard page in standard corresponding colors (red, yellow, green).
* All stories, tasks, and projects can be edited after being created.
* Our predefined sort categories are intentionally simple and straightforward.
